## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Welcome to the Valdovinos Lab github organization! We are a theoretical ecology lab doing research on ecological networks spanning from plant-pollinator communities to food webs!
🌈 Hosting your github repositories here facilitates collaboration across the lab. Start by exploring respositories your team has full access to.
👩‍💻 Find key resources for each project in the .README file, progress on each project in the projects tab, and issues for each project in the issues tab
🍿 Any questions? Reach out to sabine (sjdritz@ucdavis.edu)
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
